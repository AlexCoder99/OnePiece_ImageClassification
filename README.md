# OnePiece Image Classification (AI service) <img src="IAonePiece_Alex/src/assets/images/one-piece-mugiwara-flag.png" width="70px"> 
I used Azure AI Custom Vision to build an image classification model that can recognize a bunch of "One Piece" characters (the anime/manga series).
Website made for fun and for practicing with machine learning. You can pick an image representing a OP character from your local device or the web and drop it into the expressed window of the website. 
The ML model will try to guess the name of the character you selected and will give you the accuracy rate of the prediction. 
The characters you can choose from are: Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Nami, Usop, Nico Robin, Chopper, Franky, Brook, Jinbe, Ace, Shanks, Crocodile, Kuzan, Dracule Mihawk.
The supported image formats are: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP. To reload the page just click the One Piece logo on the navbar. Enjoy the service!
